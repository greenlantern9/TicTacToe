Stevens CS570 Tic-Tac-Toe Assignment Git Repo

Hey Guys, here’s a repo for us to use to familiarize ourselves with git and collaborate on the Tic Tac Toe project.

I’m familiar enough with git to create this repo, clone a local repo, and some other trivial tasks, but am certainly no pro. In this readme I will attach some basic commands if necessary.

In the Tic Tac Toe task, there’s a front end (welcome screen, game board, etc), backend (generate coordinates, win criteria, etc), and data structure (caching saved games). This breakdown would work well if this were a large task, but since it’s not, we probably can break it up more easily such that we aren’t super dependent on one another’s pieces.
